# Deep Learning RoCS 2024

The **Deep Learning Workshop at the Rosseland Centre for Solar Physics (RoCS)** will take place as a in-person meeting in the week 16-20 September 2024, in Oslo, Norway.

During this week, we will have a series of talks, discussions, and hands-on sessions on the application of deep learning techniques to solar physics. The workshop will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to: signal denoising, PSF (spatial/spectral) deconvolution, magnetic field extrapolations, feature detection/tracking, radiative transfer/inversions, uncertainty estimation, explainability, etc.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on deep learning techniques in solar physics to share their knowledge, discuss the latest developments in the field, and foster collaborations. The workshop will be an opportunity for participants to present their work, exchange ideas, and learn from each other.
